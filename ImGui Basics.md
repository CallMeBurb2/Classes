ImGui is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++. 
It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline enabled application. 
It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic and self-contained (no external dependencies).
This is the most common GUI system in C++, and is a **MUST KNOW** for all C++ developing and rebranding.
